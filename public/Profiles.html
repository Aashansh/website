							<p>Abishekh is an energetic and eager ten year old boy who is currently in 5th Grade at Aadarsh Nagar in Worli, Mumbai. He is living in a house with seven of his brothers and sisters, along with an inattentive mother who is currently unemployed and struggling to provide for her large family. Despite his hardships, Abhishekh can charm every person he meets with his infectious smile and energy.</p>

							<p>In the classroom and at his mentorship sessions, Abhishekh is an attentive listener who is eager to impress his teachers, mentors or anyone else who will listen! Abhishekh doesn't know what classes he has in school, but he definitely learns basic science, maths and language. He adores his teachers and his mentor, Sahil. He works hard to please them in any way that he can.</p>

							<p>Abhishekh's greatest asset is his ambitiousness. He will not only complete any task given to him, but he will make sure that he does it well. Even though he lacks support from his family, he is internally motivated to perform well. One day, Abhishekh wants to be a police officer and will definitely work hard to achieve this dream, as there is nothing that Abhishekh hates more than feeling like he has failed.</p>

							<p>Amit is an eight year old boy who is well-spoken, neat and respectful. He is currently in grade level? at Aadarsh Nagar School in Worli, and works hard in class. Both his appearance and schoolwork are very organised and he takes a lot of pride in doing so. Amit is currently living with another family, as he has lost his mother. Although he has faced many hardships, he is a very diligent student and is fully committed to learning, both through school and his mentorship sessions.</p>

							<p>During his mentorship sessions, Amit is focused and is quick to grasp basic spelling and arithmetic. When faced with a challenge topic, he will persevere until he fully understands it and is then able to apply it later. For example, when learning addition, he was initially only adding three digit numbers. However, within only a couple hours, he actually requested a seven digit number, and got the question correct! His intelligence as well as his excitement about learning will both be huge contributing factors to success in his future.</p>

							<p>When he is older, Amit would really like to be ambition? and his mentors at Aashansh have no doubts that he will be successful in doing so. Not only is Amit a good student, but he also has a great sense of humour and knows how to get his way! All of these qualities make him a role model student, friend, brother and child who is completely unforgettable.</p>

Even though she comes from a street community, her parents are very cooperative and would not leave a chance to get their children educated. She is very naughty. Many times we have lost of many important sources and links (stake holders) as she never stops to explore the fun she has with Aashansh teachers and mentors. She constantly looks for ways to explore her naughtiness but is equally responsible for what she does. She understand social ethics and uses golden words like sorry, thank you and please to ease the situation. We met her few years ago, just like her elder sister, she used to scratch her head while she had lies in her head, pale dead looking and angry looking face or rather a frustrated/irritated looking face, no clothing sense, no talking sense etc and much more that you and we usually encounter either in a street or a slum community.</p>

							<p>In-spite of so many issues, Shyam stands out as a leader amongst his peers and children in school and at Aashansh. His mentors and teachers at Aashansh are just to fond of him. He is reliable and trust worthy. You give him some work to do and he gets back to you asap with you work done! Trained and mentored by Aashansh, he is made so capable today that he can set examples for others to follow in the community and seems like he is already setting an example.</p>

							<p>Shyam has his own ambition and only shares his dreams with people whom he trusts the most; His mentor and few at Aashansh. He wishes to become a pilot when he grows up and his math is just awesome. He has good critical thinking skills and makes responsible decision.</p>
